1. /node_modules/bcrypt will be windows version. Delete it and grab a copy of bcrypt from inside "linux bcrypt node module". Paste it into node_modules.


1.1: The rest can be skipped if the .env file changes NODE_ENV from "development" to "production"

2. ./bin/www will need to be changed to use https with local credentials. They should be in comments that you can uncomment.

3. app.js will need to be updated have session cookies be set to secure : true.
